## Q1. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

### Q1.1 Speed, memory, and data types

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading plain text data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three functions: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the data.table package.

Which function is fastest? Is there difference in the (default) parsed data types? How much memory does each resultant dataframe or tibble use? (Hint: `system.time` measures run times; `pryr::object_size` measures memory usage; all these readers can take gz file as input without explicit decompression.) 

**Solution:** The fread function is the fastest. 

I used str() to check the parsed data types and found: read.csv in base R creates a data.frame; read_csv in tidyverse creates a tibble, and fread in the data.table package creates a data.table which also behaves like data.frame. 

The memory use for each function is shown below.
```{r}
system.time(base_read <- read.csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz"))
system.time(tidyverse_read <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz"))
system.time(fread_read <- fread("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz"))

object_size(base_read)
object_size(tidyverse_read)
object_size(fread_read)
```
```{r}
str(base_read)
str(tidyverse_read)  
str(fread_read)
```

### Q1.2 User-supplied data types

Re-ingest `admissions.csv.gz` by indicating appropriate column data types in `read_csv`. Does the run time change? How much memory does the result tibble use? (Hint: `col_types` argument in `read_csv`.)

**Solution:** The run time is almost the same as me not indicating column data types. And the memory is exactly the same as just using read_csv.
```{r}
system.time(specified_column<-read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz", col_types = NULL))
object_size(specified_column)
```


## Q2. Ingest big data files

<p align="center">
  <img src="./bigfile.png" width="50%">
</p>

Let us focus on a bigger file, `labevents.csv.gz`, which is about 130x bigger than `admissions.csv.gz`.
```{bash}
ls -l ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz
```
Display the first 10 lines of this file.
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head -10
```

### Q2.1 Ingest `labevents.csv.gz` by `read_csv`

<p align="center">
  <img src="./readr_logo.png" width="20%">
</p>

Try to ingest `labevents.csv.gz` using `read_csv`. What happens? If it takes more than 3 minutes on your computer, then abort the program and report your findings. 

**Solution:** My R crashes. The reason is the file is too huge once decompressed. The reading process is taking more memory than my computer's capability(8gb ram).
```{r}
read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz")
```

### Q2.2 Ingest selected columns of `labevents.csv.gz` by `read_csv`

Try to ingest only columns `subject_id`, `itemid`, `charttime`, and `valuenum` in `labevents.csv.gz` using `read_csv`.  Does this solve the ingestion issue? (Hint: `col_select` argument in `read_csv`.)

**Solution:** No, it does not solve the ingestion issue, still taking forever to run chunk.
```{r}
system.time(read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz", col_select= c("subject_id", "itemid", "charttime", "valuenum")))

```


### Q2.3 Ingest a subset of `labevents.csv.gz`

<p align="center">
  <img src="./linux_logo.png" width="20%">
</p>

Our first strategy to handle this big data file is to make a subset of the `labevents` data.  Read the [MIMIC documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/) for the content in data file `labevents.csv`.

In later exercises, we will only be interested in the following lab items: creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931) and the following columns: `subject_id`, `itemid`, `charttime`, `valuenum`. Write a Bash command to extract these columns and rows from `labevents.csv.gz` and save the result to a new file `labevents_filtered.csv.gz` in the current working directory. (Hint: Use `zcat <` to pipe the output of `labevents.csv.gz` to `awk` and then to `gzip` to compress the output. Do **not** put `labevents_filtered.csv.gz` in Git! To save render time, you can put `#| eval: false` at the beginning of this code chunk. TA will change it to `#| eval: true` before rendering your qmd file.)

Display the first 10 lines of the new file `labevents_filtered.csv.gz`. How many lines are in this new file, excluding the header? How long does it take `read_csv` to ingest `labevents_filtered.csv.gz`?

**Solution:** There are 32679896 lines in the new filtered file excluding the header. It takes the system around 0.5 seconds for `read_csv` to ingest the filtered csv.gz.(32 seconds for user)


```{bash}
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | awk -F',' '
NR==1 || ($5 == 50912 || $5 == 50971 || $5 == 50983 || $5 == 50902 || 
          $5 == 50882 || $5 == 51221 || $5 == 51301 || $5 == 50931) { 
    print $2 "," $5 "," $7 "," $10 
}' | gzip > labevents_filtered.csv.gz
```

```{bash}
zcat < labevents_filtered.csv.gz | head -10
```

```{bash}
zcat < labevents_filtered.csv.gz | tail -n +2 |wc -l
```

```{r}
system.time(read.csv("labevents_filtered.csv.gz"))
```


### Q2.4 Ingest `labevents.csv` by Apache Arrow

<p align="center">
  <img src="./arrow_logo.png" width="30%">
</p>

Our second strategy is to use [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) for larger-than-memory data analytics. Unfortunately Arrow does not work with gz files directly. First decompress `labevents.csv.gz` to `labevents.csv` and put it in the current working directory (do not add it in git!). To save render time, put `#| eval: false` at the beginning of this code chunk. TA will change it to `#| eval: true` when rendering your qmd file.

Then use [`arrow::open_dataset`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/open_dataset.html) to ingest `labevents.csv`, select columns, and filter `itemid` as in Q2.3. How long does the ingest+select+filter process take? Display the number of rows and the first 10 rows of the result tibble, and make sure they match those in Q2.3. (Hint: use `dplyr` verbs for selecting columns and filtering rows.)

Write a few sentences to explain what is Apache Arrow. Imagine you want to explain it to a layman in an elevator. 

**Solution:** It takes 3.69 seconds of system time for apache arrow to finish the entire process. Apache Arrow is a tool that makes working with big data super fast and simple. Imagine you have a huge file, like a giant table, and instead of making copies or waiting a long time to load it, Arrow lets different programs—like Python, R, or databases—read it directly and quickly. It saves memory and speeds up tasks, like analyzing data or running models. It provides a smart way for different tools to share and work with the same data without wasting time or resources.

```{r}
system.time({
  apache_tibble <- arrow::open_dataset("labevents.csv", format = "csv") %>%
  filter(itemid %in% c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 51221, 51301, 50931)) %>%
  select(subject_id, itemid, charttime, valuenum) %>%
  collect()})

head(apache_tibble)
nrow(apache_tibble)
```

### Q2.5 Compress `labevents.csv` to Parquet format and ingest/select/filter

<p align="center">
  <img src="./parquet_logo.png" width="30%">
</p>

Re-write the csv file `labevents.csv` in the binary Parquet format (Hint: [`arrow::write_dataset`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/write_dataset.html).) How large is the Parquet file(s)? How long does the ingest+select+filter process of the Parquet file(s) take? Display the number of rows and the first 10 rows of the result tibble and make sure they match those in Q2.3. (Hint: use `dplyr` verbs for selecting columns and filtering rows.)

Write a few sentences to explain what is the Parquet format. Imagine you want to explain it to a layman in an elevator.

**Solution:** Parquet is a way to store data that’s smart and efficient. Instead of saving data row by row like a regular file (like CSV), it saves it column by column. This makes it faster to work with, especially if you only need specific parts of the data. Plus, it compresses the data, so it takes up less space on your computer. Think of it like packing your suitcase neatly to fit more stuff while keeping it easy to find what you need. It’s great for handling big datasets quickly!

```{r}
system.time({
  arrow::write_dataset(
    open_dataset("labevents.csv", format = "csv"),
    path = "labevents_parquet", 
    format = "parquet"
  )
})

system.time({
  parquet_tibble <- arrow::open_dataset("labevents_parquet", format = "parquet") %>%
    filter(itemid %in% c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 51221, 51301, 50931)) %>%
    select(subject_id, itemid, charttime, valuenum) %>%
    collect() 
})

head(parquet_tibble, 10)
nrow(parquet_tibble)
```


### Q2.6 DuckDB

<p align="center">
  <img src="./duckdb_logo.png" width="20%">
</p>

Ingest the Parquet file, convert it to a DuckDB table by [`arrow::to_duckdb`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/to_duckdb.html), select columns, and filter rows as in Q2.5. How long does the ingest+convert+select+filter process take? Display the number of rows and the first 10 rows of the result tibble and make sure they match those in Q2.3. (Hint: use `dplyr` verbs for selecting columns and filtering rows.)

Write a few sentences to explain what is DuckDB. Imagine you want to explain it to a layman in an elevator.

**Solution:** It takes around 2 seconds for the system to process the entire workflow. DuckDB is a super-fast, lightweight database designed for data analysis. It’s great for working with large files like CSVs or Parquet, and it can handle millions of rows quickly without using too much memory. DuckDB helps you filter, sort, and analyze data much faster than using traditional data frames. It’s like SQLite for analytics, but designed to crunch numbers at lightning speed. 

```{r}
system.time({
  parquet_dataset <- arrow::open_dataset("labevents_parquet", format = "parquet")

  duckdb_connection <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())
  duckdb_table <- arrow::to_duckdb(parquet_dataset, con = duckdb_connection)
  
  duckdb_tibble <- duckdb_table %>%
    filter(itemid %in% c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 51221, 51301, 50931)) %>%
    select(subject_id, itemid, charttime, valuenum) %>%
    collect()  
})

head(duckdb_tibble, 10)
nrow(duckdb_tibble)

dbDisconnect(duckdb_connection)
```


## Q3. Ingest and filter `chartevents.csv.gz`

[`chartevents.csv.gz`](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head -10
```
How many rows? 433 millions.
```{bash}
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | tail -n +2 | wc -l
```
[`d_items.csv.gz`](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`.
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head -10
```
In later exercises, we are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), mean non-invasive blood pressure (220181), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items, using the favorite method you learnt in Q2. 

Document the steps and show code. Display the number of rows and the first 10 rows of the result tibble.
```{bash}


```
